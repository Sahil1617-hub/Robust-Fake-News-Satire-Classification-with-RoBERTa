Fake News Detection with RoBERTa
This project implements an end-to-end Fake News Detection system using the RoBERTa transformer model fine-tuned on a combined dataset from ISOT, LIAR, and Satire news sources. It classifies news articles into real, fake, and satire categories, providing a robust solution to detect misinformation in text data.

Features:

Data aggregation and cleaning with advanced preprocessing

Multi-class classification using transformer-based RoBERTa model

Training with PyTorch, optimized with AdamW and learning rate scheduling

Support for GPU acceleration and efficient batching

Comprehensive evaluation with accuracy and classification reports

Model saving/loading for easy deployment and inference

Extensible design to incorporate additional datasets or labels

Technologies: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Scikit-learn, Pandas

This repository serves as a foundation for fake news detection research and practical applications in misinformation identification.
